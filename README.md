## To Do List Project

![toDoList](https://github.com/mock3ng/Frontend-Challenge/blob/To-Do-List/to-do-list.png)


This is a HTML code for a "To Do List" web page using Bootstrap. The page contains a navigation bar with three links ("Home", "How", and "MyList"), a card for adding new tasks to the list, a card for displaying the list of tasks, and a button for clearing all the tasks. The list items can be checked and unchecked, edited, and deleted using a dropdown menu.

The page uses Bootstrap's grid system for responsive design, and also includes Font Awesome icons for the dropdown menu. JavaScript is used to handle user interactions and store the list of tasks in local storage.

Overall, this is a well-designed and functional web page for managing a to-do list. However, there are some minor issues with the code, such as missing closing tags and inconsistent indentation, which could be improved for better readability and maintainability.
